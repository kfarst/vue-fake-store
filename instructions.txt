Fake Store
----------

Create a fake store where users can view products, add them to a cart, and perform a checkout.
The mock e-commerce app must be written in Vue.js. The products must be fetched from the Fake
Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/).

Tasks
-----

1. Load products from the API onto a grid style UI. Each product must display a picture, the name
of the product, a description, the price, and an `Add to Cart` button. While the products are being
fetched, some sort of loading state must be shown.

2. Clicking `Add to Cart` will add the product to a shopping cart. A user can select the product
multiple times which will add to its quantity. Ideally, the cart item count should be displayed
somewhere on the screen as a confirmation to the user that the product was added after clicking the button.

3. Create a view of the shopping cart once products are added. Users should see a picture, title, item price,
item quantity, and subtotal (price * quantity) for each product listed. The user has the ability to delete
the product from the cart (either deleting the product entirely or decreasing the quantity). When all products
are deleted from the cart, an empty cart message should be shown to the user.

4. Create a checkout form for the cart items. You shoud collect email, first name, last name, street address,
city, state, and zip. Each field must have at least one validation on it which will display an error message
to the user to prompt them to fix the error. If all errors are fixed or there are no errors once the use fills
out the form, display some sort of message that the form has been submitted.

5. Write unit or component tests for at least one component or class in the app.
